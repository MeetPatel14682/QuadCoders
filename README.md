## Project Overview

QuadCoders is a student/team project focused on building a full‑stack web application. The repository contains both a **Frontend** and a **Backend** workspace and supporting documents produced during evaluation phases.

This README provides a professional, detailed guide for developers who will run, test, maintain, or extend the project. Keep this file updated whenever the repository structure, build steps, or operational procedures change.

---

## Key Features

* Modular frontend application (Next.js) for the user interface and client flows.
* Separately maintained backend service that exposes REST / API routes for business logic and persistence (see `Backend/`).
* Audit and evaluation document included (e.g., `Mid Evaluation.pdf`) for project context and milestones.

---

## Architecture & Repo Layout

```
/ (root)
├─ Backend/            # Backend service — API, business logic, DB models
├─ Frontend/           # Next.js application (UI)
├─ Mid Evaluation.pdf  # Project evaluation report
└─ README.md           # This document (project overview)
```

> Note: If you add other services or microservices later (mobile app, worker queue, infra), list them here and update this section.

---

## Technology Stack (Suggested)

* Frontend: **Next.js** (React) — server-side rendering + client app.
* Backend: **Node.js** (likely Express or similar) — REST API surface.
* Database: Use a robust production-ready DB (Postgres, MySQL, or MongoDB) depending on the current implementation.
* Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or session-based auth for protected routes.
* Dev tooling: ESLint, Prettier, Husky (pre-commit hooks), and Jest or Vitest for tests.

> If you maintain a `package.json` in `Backend/` or `Frontend/`, the exact packages and scripts there are the authoritative source — update this section if they differ.

---

## Quickstart — Development Setup

These steps assume you have `node` (v16+), `npm` or `pnpm`/`yarn`, and Git installed.

### 1) Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MeetPatel14682/QuadCoders.git
cd QuadCoders
```

### 2) Frontend (Next.js)

```bash
cd Frontend
# install dependencies
npm install
# run development server
npm run dev
# build for production
npm run build
# start production build
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in development mode.

> If `Frontend/package.json` uses `pnpm` or `yarn`, use the corresponding package manager. Check the `scripts` section for exact commands.

### 3) Backend

```bash
cd ../Backend
npm install
# run development server (typical script names: start, dev)
npm run dev
```

* Confirm the backend server's port (commonly `3001`, `4000`, or as defined in `.env`).
* Validate that the API routes respond (use Postman / curl): `GET /health` or root route if available.

---

## Configuration & Environment Variables

Create an `.env` file in each service (Backend and Frontend if required). Example (replace with actual keys used by your code):

**Backend `.env` (example)**

```
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/quadcoders_db
JWT_SECRET=replace_this_with_strong_secret
SOME_API_KEY=...
```

**Frontend `.env.local` (Next.js example)**

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPS_KEY=...
```

> Make sure secrets are never committed. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` and consider adding an example file `env.example` with placeholders.

---

## Database & Persistence

* Inspect `Backend/` for migration scripts or an ORM (Sequelize, TypeORM, Prisma, or Mongoose). Follow the repository-specific instructions to create the database and run migrations.
* Example steps (Postgres + Prisma):

  1. Create DB: `createdb quadcoders_db`
  2. Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate deploy` or `npm run migrate`

If your backend uses MongoDB, run a local MongoDB instance or use MongoDB Atlas and set `DATABASE_URL` accordingly.

---

## Testing & Quality Assurance

* Unit tests: locate `test` or `__tests__` folders in either service and run `npm test`.
* Linting: run `npm run lint` (if configured).
* End-to-end: consider Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium for E2E tests against the full stack.

Include automated checks in CI (see `/.github/workflows` if present) that run linting, unit tests, and build.

---

## Deployment

**Frontend (recommended):** Vercel for Next.js apps.

* Connect the `Frontend/` folder as the project root in Vercel.
* Set environment variables in Vercel UI.

**Backend (recommended):** Render, Heroku, Railway, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk / ECS.

* Ensure the backend has environment variables and a managed database.
* Configure health checks and logs.

**CI/CD:** Configure GitHub Actions to run tests and deploy on push to `main` (or releases).

---

## Security & Operational Considerations

* **Secrets management:** Use secret stores (Vercel/Heroku env vars, AWS Secrets Manager) — never hardcode keys.
* **Input validation & sanitization:** Validate all user inputs server-side. Use libraries like `express-validator` or schema-based validation (Zod, Joi).
* **Authentication:** Protect admin endpoints; follow least privilege principle.
* **Webhook verification:** If integrating third-party services (payments, SMS), implement signature verification.
* **Rate limiting & brute-force protection:** Use rate limit middleware and CAPTCHA for public endpoints if necessary.
* **Logging & Monitoring:** Centralize logs (Papertrail, LogDNA) and configure alerts for failed deployments and crashed processes.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/awesome-feature`.
2. Run tests and linting locally before committing.
3. Make PRs to `main` with a clear title and description. Include screenshots, steps to test, and linked issues.
4. Use conventional commits or a commit convention used by the team.
5. Maintainers will review and merge; contributors should respond to review comments.

Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` to the repo with templates for issues and PRs for a better onboarding experience.

---

## Project Governance & Contact

Maintainers (as listed in repository contributors):

* Meet Patel
* Het421
* MeghBavarva
* (others listed in GitHub contributors)

For project-related queries, open an Issue or contact the maintainers via the address listed in the project or the team coordinator.

---

## License & Acknowledgements

* Add a `LICENSE` file to the repository. If none exists, choose an appropriate license (MIT, Apache‑2.0, GPL, etc.).
* Acknowledge third-party libraries, learning resources, and any mentors / evaluators that contributed to the project.

---

## Next recommended steps (for maintainers)

1. Add an up-to-date `README.md` to the repository root (this document).
2. Add `env.example` files in both `Backend/` and `Frontend/` showing required env variables.
3. Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for open collaboration.
4. Implement CI workflows to run lint/build/test on PRs.
5. Add automated deployment pipelines for both frontend and backend.
